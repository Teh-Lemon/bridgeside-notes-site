### NHS Style Guide: 
https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/voice-and-tone
Our voice is **neutral** and **factual**. It's **authoritative**, but also **calm** and **reassuring**.
It's **empowering**, rather than patronising, and personal, rather than formal.

We:
- address the user as "you"
- reassure by saying things like "Sertraline can cause side effects, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones"
- empower by saying things like "talk to your doctor about..." rather than "your doctor will tell you about..."
- avoid using "should" as it can sound patronising

Using a consistent voice is similar to using the same visual style and colours throughout. It reminds users this is a trusted NHS service.
